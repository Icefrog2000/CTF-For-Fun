Last night mr. heker broke into our systems and stole our flag. All our communications are secure and we can't tell how the data leave our network.

I will send you an abnormal trace of communication. Please analize it and let me know if you figure it out. We need to get back that flag.

By the way. You know how mr. heker loves to play with people's mind. He delivered a video with a creepy toy repeating the words "tic toc, tic toc". I am not sure if it is a clue or just a silly game of him.
