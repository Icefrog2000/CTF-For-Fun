Remember the P.A.I.N.T.: Professional Arctic Interactive NT drawing service? It's the web challenge, but we are also hosting an art competition for it. You have the entire CTF until 19:00 UTC on Saturday the 18th of December to draw your best artwork, and keep it up in the face of trolls and griefers!

 

Top 5 artworks will receive points! When painting, make sure to pass in the team= parameter so we can know which team you are part of. Good luck!
